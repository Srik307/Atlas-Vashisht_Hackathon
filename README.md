## Problem statement 
- Traditional database interaction methods are often complex, requiring advanced technical skills and language proficiency. This creates barriers for non-technical users, especially when dealing with multilingual data.<br>
Our project Atlas AI aims to overcome these challenges by offering an intuitive interface that translates natural language queries into SQL, simplifying data retrieval and analysis for users of all backgrounds.

## About the project

Features of Atlas AI:

- Multilingual Translation: Supports translation of queries from Dutch to English.<br>
- Natural Language Processing: Understands user queries in their natural language form.<br>
- SQL Query Generation: Converts translated queries into SQL queries.<br>
- Database Interaction: Executes SQL queries on connected databases and retrieves relevant results.<br>
- User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive interface for simplified querying, accessible to users of all levels.<br>
- Efficiency and Accessibility: Removes language barriers, enhancing efficiency and accessibility in data analysis. <br>
## Technical implemntaion 

Approach:

- Translation and NLP:
Utilize language translation APIs for Dutch to English conversion.
Apply NLP techniques for natural language understanding.

- Query Generation:
Analyze translated text to extract user intent.
Convert intent into SQL queries using parsing algorithms.

- Database Interaction:
Establish connections with DBMS using appropriate libraries.
Execute SQL queries against the database.

- Result Retrieval:
Fetch query results using database connectors.
Present results to the user in a structured format.
